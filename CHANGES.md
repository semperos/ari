# v "next"

* Planned: Simpler REPL for use with editor environments where auto-complete and line editing aren't necessary, based on Goal's REPL.

# v0.1.0 2024-08-26

* Initial release
* Goal language with HTTP, SQL, and nascent date/time extensions.
* Custom CLI with auto-completion and feature-rich line editing with bubbline library.
* Starting to use ari for load-bearing scripting and data analysis, so it's time to cut an initial release.
