# Ari

Ari stands for **A**rray **R**elational **I**nteractive programming environment.

Ari is a set of extensions to the [Goal] programming language that includes SQL support, an HTTP client with rate limiting support, and GUI bindings (Fyne).

This is my personal daily driver for scripting and data analysis, even in the age of coding agents.

## Installation

```shell
go install github.com/semperos/ari@latest
```

## Practical Usage

- [Examples in this repo](examples)
- [Shortcut API Client](https://github.com/semperos/sc-client-goal)
- [Personal Anthology](https://goalprogramming.info/personal-anthology.html)

## Development

Ari is implemented in Go and Goal. See the `scripts` folder for common development operations.

To publish a new version of Ari:

```shell
./scripts/release vx.y.z
```

## Background

In 2024 I stumbled into a flexible, powerful setup using Julia and DuckDB to do data analysis:

- Julia as primary programming language
- Julia Pluto Notebooks as primary programming environment
- Notebook One: Data ETL
  - HTTP: Calling HTTP APIs to fetch JSON data (GitHub, Shortcut)
  - CSV: Transforming fetched JSON data into CSV
  - SQL: (Out of band) Defining SQL tables using SQL schema
  - SQL: (Out of band) Importing CSV into DuckDB using a schema defined in a SQL file
- Notebook Two: Data Analyses
  - SQL: DuckDB tables as source of truth
  - Julia: Wrote trivial utility fn to transform arbitrary SQL query results into Julia DataFrames
    - `DataFrame(DBInterface.execute(conn, sql))`
    - Renders as a well-formatted table in the notebook interface
    - Array-language-like story for interacting with the DataFrame
    - Fully dynamic: type information from the database schema used to dynamically populate the DataFrame with data of appropriate types.
  - Julia: Mustache package for templating functions to build a LaTeX report to house all analyses
  - Julia: Plots package for generating plots as PDF to insert into final LaTeX report
  - Julia: Statistics, StatsBase packages both for aggregates and data to plot, pull from DataFrames
  - Julia: Executed external `latexmk` using Julia's `run` to build LaTeX report

Why move away from this setup?

- Concision and expressive power of array languages.
- A lot of my code was SQL via Julia.

Ari embeds the Goal array programming language. What gaps from my Julia+DuckDB experience need to be filled to use Goal where I used Julia?

- Notebook programming environment
  - Cell dependencies and automatic re-run
    - Nice-to-have
  - Autocomplete
    - Required
  - Built-in language/library help documentation
    - Required
  - Rich rendering
    - Tables: Required
    - Graphics: Nice-to-have
- HTTP Client
  - Nice-to-have (can rely on shelling out to `curl` to start).
- SQL
  - Query results as Goal tables/dictionaries/arrays
    - Required
- Plots
  - Declarative plot definition producing one of PNG/PDF or HTML/JS output
    - Required
    - q tutorials simply leverage JS bridge + Highcharts
    - Julia Plots package has pluggable backends:
      - GR (cross-platform, has C bindings)
      - Plotly (JS)
      - gnuplot (command-line utility)
      - HDF5 file format
    - See GNU Octave plotting
- See [Gonum](https://github.com/gonum)

Goal already has a number of features, so we don't need to fill these gaps to start (more flexible options may be considered in the future):

- Powerful string API
- JSON support
- CSV support
